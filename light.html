        <p class="text-1">
          Light roast coffee beans are those that spend less time in the
          roaster. When coffee beans arrive at the Two Chimps roastery, they are
          neither light nor dark. They’re green! ‘Green’ simply means unroasted,
          and the name comes from the slight olive-like colour of these raw bean
          beauties. After analysing the beans, head roaster Andy moves them into
          the roaster. This is where things start seriously hotting up… to
          around 206°C! Beats Gran Canaria any day! These scorching temperatures
          break down the complex carbohydrates in the green beans. This brings
          on the most magical transformation ever, as the grassy-tasting raw
          beans transform into mouth-lingeringly delicious roasted coffee. It’s
          magic – we swear!

          But we can’t just stand there gawking. We’ve got a roast to control!
          It’s all eyes, ears and noses throughout the roast, as we use sensory
          milestones to get the timings spot on. Then, we listen out for the
          first crack. Or ‘first pop’, as it should be called, because this is
          when the beans start to pop-pop-pop like popcorn! The roasting beans
          are releasing heat rather than absorbing it. In other (sciencey)
          terms, they’re entering into an exothermic reaction! Cool! Well, hot,
          but ya’ know what we mean… And now enter… the Development Phase. This
          is the time between the pops of the first crack and the end of the
          roast. This part’s super-important, because it’s where light roast
          coffee beans gain their light identity. Shorter development times give
          us lovely light roasts, while longer ones create the rich, caramelised
          flavours of a medium or dark roast coffee. <br />And there you have
          it! Lush, light roast coffee beans for your brew! Lost your coffee
          label? No worries. The easiest way to tell if a coffee bean is a light
          or dark roast is by its colour: Light roast coffee beans are a lighter
          shade of brown and have a matte finish. Darker roasted beans are (you
          guessed it) dark brown and shiny.
