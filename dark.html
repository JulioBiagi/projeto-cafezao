        <h1 class="title">What Is Dark Roast Coffee?</h1>
        <p class="text-1">
          Coffee roasting is the process of turning green coffee beans into
          brown ones. The easiest way to tell different roasts apart is by
          looking at the color and texture of the roasted coffee beans. Dark
          roast coffee is dark brown in color with a shiny, oily surface. Dark
          roast typically has a heavy body and low acid, with deep, sweet flavor
          notes. These coffees typically have a rich, classic diner-style coffee
          flavor.

        <h1 class="title">Why Does Dark Roast Coffee Taste Like That?</h1>
        <p class="text-1">
          For most of coffee history, coffee beans were basically just heated
          over a flame until the oils came to the bean surface. The roasting
          process was finished just before the oils started smoking, to avoid
          causing a fire. Coffee was basically just being burnt! That's too
          dark. This is the origin of super dark roast (aka French or Italian
          roast) and the reason why coffee got that “bitter, burnt, ashy”
          reputation. Read: Don't Buy Italian Roast Coffee Until You Read This
          To get a smooth-and-delicious dark roast, you need to steer away from
          ultra-dark, oily beans and find a roaster who values freshness and
          quality.
