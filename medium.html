        <h1 class="title">What Is Medium Roast Coffee?</h1>
        <p class="text-1">
          Medium Roast coffees are brown and have a little thicker body than a
          Light Roast. Unlike Light, Medium starts to take on a bit of the taste
          from the roasting process, losing some of the bright floral flavors
          that are typical of a Light Roast. Instead, they carry much more of a
          balanced flavor with a medium amount of caffeine. A Medium is roasted
          until just before the second crack, usually at about 410º–440º. Other
          roasters refer to a Medium as American Roast, Breakfast Roast, or City
          Roast. Our most popular Medium Roasts include Stargazer, Hawaiian
          Hazelnut, Southern Pecan, Papua New Guinea, and Costa Rican.

        <h1 class="title">How to differentiate this cafe from others?</h1>
        <p class="text-1">
          Medium roast coffee is a brown color and rarely has an oily surface.
          These coffees have a medium acidity and body, as well as a rounded
          flavor profile. Roasting to this level also preserves many of the
          unique flavors of the coffee's origin, but it also begins to reach
          into the deep caramel sweetness of a longer roast.Moderate and smooth,
          the medium roast is a coffee with a medium blend and little acidity,
          with plenty of flavor, but not too strong. Smooth and perfectly
          balanced, it is the base guitar of our roasts. This low-acid blend has
          a delicate sweetness with just enough body for balance. Stuck in the
          Middle is 60% less acidic with a pH level of 5.74, using a natural
          process to remove acids that can be harmful to the stomach without
          sacrificing bright flavor. You can still enjoy all the benefits of
          coffee without the uncomfortable side effects of acid reflux.
